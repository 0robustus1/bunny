h1. README

This project was started to enable me to interact with RabbitMQ using Ruby. It has borrowed heavily from two projects:

1. amqp by tmm1 (http://github.com/tmm1/amqp/tree/master)
2. carrot by famoseagle (http://github.com/famoseagle/carrot/tree/master)

I will be creating tests, examples and generally tinkering, so please bear with me. Most of the code was written in the projects mentioned above, therefore please excuse my lack of TDD/BDD.

If you have any questions, suggestions, harsh criticism or fulsome praise please feel free to contact me.

Regards,

Chris
