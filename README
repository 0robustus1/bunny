*GitHub* *repo*: http://github.com/celldee/bunny
     
=== DESCRIPTION:

Bunny is an AMQP[http://www.amqp.org] (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) client, written in Ruby, that is intended to allow you to interact with AMQP-compliant message brokers/servers such as RabbitMQ[http://www.rabbitmq.com] in a synchronous fashion.

It is based on a great deal of useful code from amqp[http://github.com/tmm1/amqp] by Aman Gupta and Carrot[http://github.com/famoseagle/carrot] by Amos Elliston.

You can use Bunny to -

* Create and delete exchanges
* Create and delete queues
* Publish and consume messages

Bunny is known to work with RabbitMQ version 1.5.4 and version 0-8 of the AMQP specification.

=== QUICK START:
