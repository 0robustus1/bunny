h1. About

Bunny is a synchronous Ruby AMQP client.

Bunny is an "AMQP":http://www.amqp.org (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) client, written in Ruby, that is intended to allow you to interact with AMQP-compliant message brokers/servers such as "RabbitMQ":http://www.rabbitmq.com in a synchronous fashion.

It is based on a great deal of useful code from "amqp":http://github.com/tmm1/amqp and "Carrot":http://github.com/famoseagle/carrot.

You can use Bunny to:

* Create and delete exchanges
* Create and delete queues
* Publish and consume messages

Bunny is known to work with RabbitMQ versions 1.5.4 and above with version 0.8 and 0.9.1 of the AMQP specification.

h1. Quick Start

<pre>
require "bunny"

b = Bunny.new(:logging => true)

# start a communication session with the amqp server
b.start

# declare a queue
q = b.queue("test1")

# publish a message to the queue
q.publish("Hello everybody!")

# get message from the queue
msg = q.pop[:payload]

puts "This is the message: " + msg + "\n\n"

# close the connection
b.stop
</pre>

... or just:

<pre>
require "bunny"

# Create a direct queue named "my_testq"
Bunny.run { |c| c.queue("my_testq") }
</pre>
